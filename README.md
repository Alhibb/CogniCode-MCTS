##  Abstract
Current Large Language Models (LLMs) operate primarily as "System 1" thinkers—generating tokens based on immediate probability distributions without lookahead. This results in syntax errors, logic bugs, and hallucinations in complex code generation tasks.

**CogniCode-MCTS** implements a "System 2" reasoning layer using **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**. It treats code generation as a state-space search problem, using:
1.  **Sandboxed Execution** as the ground-truth reward signal.
2.  **LLMs (Gemini 1.5)** as the policy generator and heuristic evaluator.
3.  **UCB1 (Upper Confidence Bound)** for balancing exploration vs. exploitation.

##  Key Features
*   **Deterministic Verification:** Code is not just generated; it is executed, tested, and verified in a secure sandbox.
*   **Self-Correction:** The agent backtracks from failed branches (syntax errors) to explore alternative implementation strategies.
*   **Modular Architecture:** Decoupled Search, Environment, and Model layers allow for benchmarking different LLMs against the MCTS logic.

##  Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alhibb/CogniCode-MCTS.git
cd CogniCode-MCTS
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##  Usage

1. Set your API key (optional if running in mock mode):
   ```bash
   export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_key_here"
   ```

2. Run the engine:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

##  Architecture
The system utilizes a **Search Tree** where:
*   **Root:** The Problem Description.
*   **Nodes:** Partial or complete code blocks.
*   **Edges:** Actions (Code Extensions) generated by the LLM.
*   **Leaves:** Terminal states (Success/Failure based on Unit Tests).
