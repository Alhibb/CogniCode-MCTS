##  Abstract
Current Large Language Models (LLMs) operate primarily as "System 1" thinkers—generating tokens based on immediate probability distributions without lookahead. This results in syntax errors, logic bugs, and hallucinations in complex code generation tasks.

**CogniCode-MCTS** implements a "System 2" reasoning layer using **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**. It treats code generation as a state-space search problem, using:
1.  **Sandboxed Execution** as the ground-truth reward signal.
2.  **LLMs (Gemini 1.5)** as the policy generator and heuristic evaluator.
3.  **UCB1 (Upper Confidence Bound)** for balancing exploration vs. exploitation.

##  Key Features
*   **Deterministic Verification:** Code is not just generated; it is executed, tested, and verified in a secure sandbox.
*   **Self-Correction:** The agent backtracks from failed branches (syntax errors) to explore alternative implementation strategies.
*   **Modular Architecture:** Decoupled Search, Environment, and Model layers allow for benchmarking different LLMs against the MCTS logic.

##  Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alhibb/CogniCode-MCTS.git
cd CogniCode-MCTS
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##  Usage

1. Set your API key (optional if running in mock mode):
   ```bash
   export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_key_here"
   ```

2. Run the engine:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

##  Architecture
The system utilizes a **Search Tree** where:
*   **Root:** The Problem Description.
*   **Nodes:** Partial or complete code blocks.
*   **Edges:** Actions (Code Extensions) generated by the LLM.
*   **Leaves:** Terminal states (Success/Failure based on Unit Tests).

##  Experimental Results & Robustness

In initial testing on the Gemini Free Tier, the system demonstrated **Architectural Resilience**. 

When the API quotas were exceeded (HTTP 429), the `CogniCode` engine automatically degraded gracefully:
1.  **Detected** the rate limit.
2.  **Switched** strategy from Cloud Inference (Gemini) to Local Heuristic Search (Mock/Local Model).
3.  **Preserved** the search tree state.
4.  **Successfully resolved** the factorial problem at **Iteration 23**.

**Log Sample:**
```text
21:20:05 - ITER 1: Visited depth 0 | Reward: 0.1
21:20:05 - API Error: 429 You exceeded your current quota...
...
21:20:06 - ITER 22: Visited depth 7 | Reward: 0.1
21:20:06 - ITER 23:  SOLUTION FOUND at depth 3
```
